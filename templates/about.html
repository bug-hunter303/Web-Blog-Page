      To whoever reading this â€” thank you for checking out my project! ðŸŒ±<br><br>
      This is my <strong>first Django project</strong>, and it took alot of learning, trial and errors to get everything running.  
      I followed a YouTube tutorial for the core structure, but implemented FBV (Function-Based Views) by myself instead of CBV (this was used in the tutorial) 
      and added my own logic and design for final touches.<br><br>
      I also used <strong>AI tools like Perplexity</strong> to improve my CSS and HTML.  
      Through this project, I've learned a lot â€” from setting up models and forms to managing logins and pagination.  
      It made me much more confident in Django, but I still revisit the code to refresh things sometimes as I get confused in making models , views (especially logins/ forms, Class Based Views ) ðŸ˜….<br><br>
      I'm excited to keep improving and building even better projects in the future!  
      <br><br>
      <span class="highlight">Thanks for reading until here </span><br>
      Do give me feedback if possible â€” have a great day ahead!
